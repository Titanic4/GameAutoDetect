# GameAutoDetect

This CLI program will detect and automatically setup TruckersMP path for the new launcher. 
Legacy launcher support is disabled by default. You can enable it by appending -legacy parameter when you launch the main excutable. 
If you use it, you'll get UAC window. This is normal as updating legacy launcher's settings requires elevated permissions to do so.
